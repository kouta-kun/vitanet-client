# Vitanet Client
This is the client for the vitanet project!
At this stage it is basically an infinite
MMO chatbox for the PSVITA (works on PC too but
that's no fun). The server supports actors
in quite a flexible way so there is capability
to build a more interactive game on it, but at
the time it's basically just a huge chatbox.

streamed from the serverside and are CC-BY 3.0
